# Work-Day-Scheduler

This Work Day scheduler was created as a way to showcase my skills in using HTML and it's API's (Bootstrap) and Javascript and it's API's (JQuery & Moment). 

When the user opens the planner, they will see the current time highlighted in yellow. They will see past time in green, and future time shown in purple. When the user adds an event and clicks 'save', the input will be saved to local storage, and will be available when the page is refreshed. The user will also see the current date displayed at the top of the page. 

To accomplish this, I used variables, if/else statements, and event listeners so the page is responsive to user clicks. 

By completing this project, I was able to consolidate my skills using Javascript/Jquery and understand the functionality behind each rule, and visualise how their execution can change a webpage.

Within this repository, you will find:
- Links to the live webpage of my quiz
- Screenshots of the webpage
- HTML, CSS, and Javascript coding associated with the page
- This README 
- An assets folder, containing images used in the webpage
